## About

Both the BHSA and the
[OpenScriptures](https://github.com/openscriptures/morphhb)
add linguistic markup to the Hebrew Bible.

The BHSA is the product of years of encoding work by researchers,
in a strongly algorithmic fashion,
although not without human decisions at the micro level.

OpenScriptures represents a crowd sourced approach.

In this repo we compare them.
As a by-product, a mapping of BHSA words to OS morphemes is made,
and the OS morphological information of each word is made available
as a new word feature in the BHSA.

When we first made the comparison, in 2017,
only 88% of the OpenScriptures Morphology was completed.

In 2021 we have pulled the same repository again, used a new version of the BHSA
and did the comparison again.
